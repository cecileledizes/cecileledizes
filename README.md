## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to CÃ©cile Le Dizes's profile

I am a Ph.D. candidate specializing in **fluid dynamics** and **ocean science**.

### Boundary Element Method for internal tide generation
I have developed a Boundary Element Method for simulating the generation of internal tides by arbitrary three-dimensional topographies. 
More informations on the code can be found [**here**](https://github.com/cecileledizes/ITIDES-3D).

### Posters and presentations
My posters and presentations can be found [**here**](https://github.com/cecileledizes/communications).
